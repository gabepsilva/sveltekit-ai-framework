# Weltkit

[![CI](https://github.com/gabepsilva/sveltekit-ai-framework/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gabepsilva/sveltekit-ai-framework/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An experimental SvelteKit foundation designed for development driven primarily by AI agents. The repository emphasizes deterministic, reviewable quality gates before application features are added.

## Requirements

- Bun 1.3.9
- Docker with a running daemon
- Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit installed through Playwright

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bunx playwright install --with-deps chromium firefox webkit
```

## Development

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Quality gates

Checks are tiered by how long they take, so the loop you run most often stays short.
Every tier runs to completion and aggregates its results, rather than stopping at the
first failure and making you pay another round trip per error.

| Command               | Purpose                                              | Requires         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `bun run precommit`   | Formatting, lint, suppression ratchet. Fail-fast.    | Nothing          |
| `bun run verify:fast` | Every static check plus server unit tests.           | Nothing          |
| `bun run verify`      | Adds workflow lint, coverage, build, bundle budgets. | Docker, Chromium |
| `bun run verify:deep` | Adds mutation testing and end-to-end flows.          | Docker, browsers |
| `bun run ci`          | Adds Gitleaks and Semgrep. The merge gate.           | Docker, browsers |
| `bun run nightly`     | Trivy and ZAP. Scheduled, never a merge gate.        | Docker, Chromium |

Each run writes `reports/quality/gate-<tier>.json`: every step with its exit code, duration,
log path, and machine-readable artifact. Re-run a single step with
`bun scripts/quality/gate.ts <tier> --only <step>`.

The pre-commit hook is installed by `bun install` and lives in `.githooks/`.

### Proving the gates

`bun run test:gates` applies a deliberately broken input to a disposable copy of the tree,
one per gate, and asserts the gate fails. Every threshold in this repository is therefore
demonstrated rather than asserted. Fixtures are generated at run time, because a stored
fixture for the secret scanner would trip the secret scanner on this repository.

Adding a gate without a fixture is incomplete work: the self-test is what separates a
quality framework from a collection of configuration.

### Blocking versus advisory security

Gitleaks and Semgrep are derived from the code in the repository, so they are reproducible
and they block a merge. Trivy and ZAP depend on external feeds whose results change without
any code change; gating on them would contradict the determinism this repository promises,
so they run on a schedule and open an issue instead.

Generated reports are written under `coverage/`, `playwright-report/`, and `reports/`. They are
ignored by Git and uploaded by GitHub Actions.

## Pull requests

CI runs its gates as parallel jobs, so a formatting failure surfaces in about a minute rather
than behind half an hour of browser and container work. The `main` branch is protected by the
hosted `CI / Quality and security` check, which passes only when every parallel gate succeeds. The Codex review job is advisory and runs only after deterministic CI succeeds. It is enabled for same-repository pull requests after the repository secret `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured.

Repository-specific agent and review rules live in `AGENTS.md`. Workshop setup and the full before/current quality table live in `Basic Start.md`.

## Deployment

The template pins `@sveltejs/adapter-node` so that `bun run build` proves a deployable
artifact. With `adapter-auto` the build succeeded while adapting to nothing: it exited 0,
printed "Could not detect a supported production environment", and emitted no `build/`
directory, so the build gate proved compilation but never deployability. A consuming
application may swap the adapter for its own target.
